RR score in powerplay:
RR Powe playr players: 
1. past average: balls faced runs scored -> in general, 1.2 against CSK
2. balls faced runscored regression 

3. CSK bowlers(individually) in power play : Economy rate, balls ceased: calculate runs probable
4. RR batsmen bs CSK bowlers: average + regressio
5. CSK bowlers against RR batsmen in power play : Economy rate, balls ceased: calculate runs probable

Deepak chahars economy rate
